<h1> Memory Practice</h1>

        <h2> I did leanr how to to a list
            <p><em><strong> Here is an overview</strong></em></p>

<ul>
    <li> The DOM (Document Operation Model) is the structure</li>
        <li> The document has to start with the type of document "<! DOCTYPE html >"</li>
            <li> Secondly we need to mention the language Something like "lang=en_US"</li>
                <li> Then we have to start with the Header < header > < /header ></li>
                <li> This bullet point list has to start and finish with "ul" "/ul"
                </ul>
